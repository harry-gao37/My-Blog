# Server-Side Rendering Web Blog

> Server-Side Rendering Web Blog with the back end using the currently popular SpringBoot-SpringCloud microservices architecture, uses components such as Feign, Gateway, Hystrix, and Alibaba's Nacos to build the foundation environment for the project. The project also uses MyBatisPlus for persistent layer operations, uses OAuth2-JWT for distributed access, and integrates Spring Security for permission control. In addition, the project uses Alibaba's EasyExcel to implement read and write to Excel, Redis to cache home page data, Git for code version control, and Swagger to generate interface documents.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
